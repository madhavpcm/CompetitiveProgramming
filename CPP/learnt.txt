Use callgrind to profile c / cpp program . //10x overhead. 
Usage :valgrind --tool=callgrind [callgrind options] your-program [program options]

/usr/bin/time for time elapsed instead of chrono etc.
static variables property
-------------------------
Static variables after cpp 11 is thread safe. Meaning the compiler makes sure that the static variable is valid for each creation of the variable. So Inside a class or strcut if a static variable exists, always store its reference and use this reference for calculation in the program. Reduces alot of overhead.


std::endl
---------
std::endl == '\n' << std::flush; 
flush has high performance overhead and can be used at the end of the program. use \n in characters instead.
